To run any of the demos or tasks, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile the source files using the following commands:

```bash
# Compile a C++ file (replace filename.cpp with the actual filename)
g++ -o output filename.cpp

# Run the compiled executable
./output
```
